***Experience***

Genevieve graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2014 with a B.S. in Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution. As an undergraduate student, she conducted field ecology research utilizing species distribution modeling, leading a herpetology bioinventory project in the Mojave Desert. After graduating, she spent two years working in the education field in China, where she witnessed a neighboring orchard and forest be converted into a shopping mall. The experience highlighted the environmental damage that can happen with development and inspired her interest in the applications of science and management to solve global environmental issues. This led her to working in the environmental nonprofit sector for the next three years. 

At Sustainable San Mateo County, she identified solutions that individuals, decision makers, and communities can take toward more sustainable futures at the intersection of economy, equity, and the environment. She also worked at the Biodiversity Funders Group, a professional association of environmental grantmakers, where she conducted research into current environmental issues, organized gatherings and webinars on various topics, and engaged in outreach to foster collaboration amongst environmental grantmakers. Genevieve is pursuing a specialization in Conservation Planning at the Bren School, interested in natural resource ecology and management. She aspires to contribute to sustainable methods of producing healthy and culturally-appropriate food to meet global food security needs.

When not enjoying nature, she can be found looking up new baking recipes, consuming anything related to Sherlock Holmes, practicing calligraphy, scrapbooking, and visiting museums and botanical gardens. She loves to travel and is always eager to plan the next adventure.
